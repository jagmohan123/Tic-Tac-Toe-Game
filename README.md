# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game

# Objective -
Tic-tac-toe, also known as "noughts and crosses" in some parts of the world, is a classic two-player strategy game that's simple yet engaging.
It's often played on a 3x3 grid, but variations with larger grids also exist. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a row of three of your own symbols,
either "X" or "O," horizontally, vertically, or diagonally on the grid.

Here's how the game is typically played:
# Setting up the Game:
Draw a 3x3 grid on a piece of paper or use a game board specifically designed for tic-tac-toe.
Players choose their symbols, usually "X" for one player and "O" for the other.
# Taking Turns:
Players take turns to place their symbol on an empty cell of the grid.
The first player usually starts by placing their symbol in any of the nine cells.
# Winning Conditions:
The game continues with players taking alternating turns until one of the following conditions is met:
A player forms a horizontal row of three of their symbols.
A player forms a vertical column of three of their symbols.
A player forms a diagonal line of three of their symbols.
When any of these conditions are met, that player is declared the winner.
# Draw/Tie:
If all nine cells are filled, and no player has formed a winning row, the game ends in a draw or a tie. In this case, neither player wins.
Tic-tac-toe is a game of skill, but with optimal play, it's impossible for either player to win if they follow the right strategy. The game often ends in a draw when both players play perfectly. This simplicity is one of the reasons why tic-tac-toe is popular among children and can be enjoyed in a matter of minutes.
